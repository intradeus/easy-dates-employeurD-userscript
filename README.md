# Simple to read dates for employeurD

## Description
I got tired of pulling my agenda to enter my work hours in employeurD, trying to find out which day is part of which week, since they use the american week and date format (YYYY/MM/DD and weeks starting on sunday). So I created this, it saves me about 20seconds/week ==> worth it. 

## Example 
Usually, the dates shown on employeurd are written in a small font, using the YYYY/MM/DD format :  

`` Semaine du 2022/09/11 au 2022/09/17Â `` 

Instead, this userscript sets a bigger font, switches the format and adds a relative timestamp (up to 2 weeks ago/ in 2 weeks):

`` Semaine du 11/09/2022 au 17/09/2022 (1 week ago) `` 

## Usage : 
Install tampermonkey(chrome) or violentmonkey(firefox) and add this script.
